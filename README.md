## Project Overview
This project contains automated API tests for the **Simple Grocery Store API**. The tests are written as a **Postman collection** and can be executed locally using **Newman** or via **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. The project also generates HTML reports for test execution results.

---

## Project Goals
- Validate the functionality of the Simple Grocery Store API.
- Automate testing of endpoints such as products, carts, and orders.
- Ensure proper handling of authentication and invalid input scenarios.
- Generate test reports automatically for continuous integration.

---

## Technologies and Tools
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** – runtime environment for executing JavaScript scripts.
- **[Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman)** – command-line runner for Postman collections.
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** – API client to create collections and environments.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** – CI/CD workflow to run tests automatically.
- **HTML Reporter** – generates readable HTML test reports.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-grocery-store-api.git
cd simple-grocery-store-api
```
2. Install Newman globally (if not installed):
```bash
npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
```
3. Run the collection with environment variables:
```bash
newman run collections/simple_grocery.json \
  -e environments/testing_environment.json \
  -r cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export reports/report.html
```
4. Check the reports/ folder for the generated HTML report.


---

## Results
- All endpoints for **happy path**, **invalid inputs**, and **authentication scenarios** are tested.
- Test results are displayed in the CLI and saved as HTML reports.
- Examples of tested scenarios:
  - GET /products, GET /products/:id
  - POST /carts, PATCH /carts/items/:id
  - POST /orders, GET /orders, DELETE /orders/:id
  - Error handling for unauthorized access and invalid input

---

## What I Learned
- How to structure API tests using **Postman collections** and environments.
- How to run Postman tests locally with **Newman**.
- How to dynamically inject environment variables (e.g., API tokens) in CI/CD pipelines.
- Integration of API tests with **GitHub Actions** to generate automated HTML reports.
- Handling authentication, error scenarios, and edge cases in API testing.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add **more detailed test coverage** for edge cases and concurrency.
- Integrate **Slack or email notifications** for test failures.
- Parameterize collections to test multiple environments (staging, production).
